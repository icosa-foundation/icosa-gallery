Asset.url should be unique

orderBy is currently:
BEST, NEWEST, OLDEST. Defaults to BEST, which ranks assets
based on a combination of popularity and other features. 
We should improve this, but probably keep the existing variants working. BEST could possibly be "number of likes" or something for now.

triangle_count could probably be nullable. We have >10k assets with triangle_count == 0 which is too many to just change it on a whim.

## Seeding the database

TODO - explain what "seeding" means and why you'd want to

TODO - explain "from inside the container"

### With a .dump file

```
docker cp <db.dump> ig-db:/opt/
docker exec -it ig-db bash
```

Then from inside the container:

`pg_restore --data-only -U icosa -d icosa /opt/<db.dump>`

### With a .sql file

```
docker cp <db.sql> ig-db:/opt/
docker exec -it ig-db bash
```

Then from inside the container:

`psql -U icosa`

Then from inside the postgres shell:

Make sure you are connected to the correct database:

`\c`

You should see `You are now connected to database "icosa" as user "icosa".`

Import the sql data:

`\i /opt/db.sql`
