when we add the suffixed filename
=================================

We offer a version of gltf files with the suffix `_(GLTFupdated)` in a few scenarios (see usage for the `suffix` function):

For the viewer
--------------

Only when asset.has_blocks, inside the handle_blocks_preferred_format function

For downloads (per format)
--------------------------

When these conditions are met:

- The format has more than resource without an external url AND
- EITHER the role is POLYGONE_GLTF_FORMAT (in which case we offer both the suffixed and non-suffixed version)
- OR the role is UPDATED_GLTF_FORMAT and we have no local files


this sucks => import {Viewer} from "/static/js/icosa-viewer.module.js?v={% now "U" %}";

orderBy is currently:
BEST, NEWEST, OLDEST. Defaults to BEST, which ranks assets
based on a combination of popularity and other features. 
We should improve this, but probably keep the existing variants working. BEST could possibly be "number of likes" or something for now.

we should accept snake_case and camelCase url params and do the translation. The openapi docs should list both as accepted styles. If we get both variants of the same param, just choose the value of whatever we got first.



triangle_count could probably be nullable. We have >10k assets with triangle_count == 0 which is too many to just change it on a whim.



Docs for potential inclusion TODO include some info on how to wrangle this with Windows:

## Seeding the database

TODO - explain what "seeding" means and why you'd want to

TODO - explain "from inside the container"

### With a .dump file

```
docker cp <db.dump> ig-db:/opt/
docker exec -it ig-db bash
```

Then from inside the container:

`pg_restore --data-only -U icosa -d icosa /opt/<db.dump>`

### With a .sql file

```
docker cp <db.sql> ig-db:/opt/
docker exec -it ig-db bash
```

Then from inside the container:

`psql -U icosa`

Then from inside the postgres shell:

Make sure you are connected to the correct database:

`\c`

You should see `You are now connected to database "icosa" as user "icosa".`

Import the sql data:

`\i /opt/db.sql`
